<!-- REPLACE TASKS -->
<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this crowdfunding product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [x] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for interactive elements
- [x] Make a selection of which pledge to make
- [ ] See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- [ ] See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- [x] Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

<h2>Satisfaction</h2>
<h3>The Good</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The results of the SASS files and code.</li>
    <li>Took it slowly to help really acknowledge each moving part of the code.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This project isn't complete (intentionally).</li>
    <li>There are a few radio/label related issues that require attention.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    I learnt to really focus on each element before moving onto another. I had taken this project a lot slower and ended up learning more than any other projects.
    From navigation to radio buttons, I feel like I have really improved by giving my full attention to each element.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I had left this project unfinished purposely. I intend on revisting to see whether I can fully understand what I was doing, how I was doing it and why.
    I am hoping to pick up even more valueable skills from this project by revisting and practicing my ability to read the code and continue a project months later.

    When I revisit this project; I will update this section just below.
